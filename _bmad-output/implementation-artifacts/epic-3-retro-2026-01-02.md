# Epic 3 Retrospective: Consistency Engine
**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** COMPLETE

## What Went Well
- **Consistency Engine Integration:** Successfully migrated to OpenRouter and integrated Llama-3 for high-performance narrative checks.
- **Structured Reporting:** Implemented a robust `ConsistencyReportViewer` with category grouping and severity filtering.
- **Tech Debt Repayment (Story 4.0):** 
    - Implemented a resilient manual retry flow for Magic Ingest.
    - Enhanced error handling for corruption, password protection, and timeouts.
    - Redesigned the Manuscripts Dashboard to prioritize "Magic Ingest" as the hero action.
    - Improved UX with instant state sync (no manual refresh needed) and "Import Another" resets.
- **Security & Admin:** Established a persistent Super Admin account (`Dark7eaper@bearing.app`) and fixed RLS violations in the ingestion flow.

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Auth vs. Profile ID:** Encountered a friction point where Auth IDs were used instead of Public Profile IDs in DB inserts. Resolved by adding a lookup step.
- **Console Noise:** Silenced operational error logging to prevent dev-tool clutter for handled user errors.
- **State Sync:** Learned that `router.refresh()` in Next.js App Router needs explicit `useEffect` sync when the client component maintains its own local state from props.

## Action Items
- [x] Create Super Admin account
- [x] Fix Magic Ingest navigation
- [x] Document new dashboard hierarchy
- [ ] (Next) Begin Epic 4: Support & Admin Messaging
