# Quality Gate Decision: Story 5.3 Service Request Management

**Verdict**: ✅ PASS

## Summary
The "Service Request Management" story (Story 5.3) meets all functional acceptance criteria. The implementation is robust, fully tested (21 tests), and integrates correctly with the existing Service Marketplace.

## Validation Results

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- **AC 5.3.1**: My Orders list view works as expected.
- **AC 5.3.2**: Fulfilled ISBN details view verified.
- **AC 5.3.3**: Pending/Processing state verified.

### ⚠️ Issues / Notes
- **Documentation Gap**: The authoritative story file `docs/story5.3.md` appears to be missing or misplaced, despite the implementation artifact `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/story5.3.md` being present and accurate. This should be restored for documentation completeness.

## Recommendations
- **Approve for Merge**: The feature is functional and stable.
- **Fix Documentation**: Restore `docs/story5.3.md` to ensure the "Source of Truth" is preserved.
- **Update Status**: PM Agent can mark Story 5.3 as "Completed".
