1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
1.1 Purpose
The Bearing is NGANDIWEB’s flagship self-publishing ecosystem.
This PRD describes the author writing, editing, AI-assistant, and publishing workflow module to be built by Ryan Balungeli. This module is part of a larger ecosystem but must function as a standalone AWS-deployable dashboard capable of scaling into a full application.
The goal is to provide authors with a secure, intuitive, AI-powered writing studio where they can:
    • Create, upload, and edit books
    • Receive real-time AI writing improvements
    • Maintain character and plot consistency
    • Store and manage their manuscripts
    • Purchase ISBNs and other publishing services
    • Request help (graphics, marketing, websites)
    • Generate AI book covers
    • Publish blog posts for the reader community
    • Seamlessly navigate between writing, services, and publishing
The platform must deliver high precision, trained-on-good-data AI, seamless usability, and security at every step.

2. PRODUCT GOALS
Primary Goals
    1. Provide a single dashboard where authors can write, upload, edit, and manage all their books.
    2. Integrate a fine-tuned AI assistant to improve writing quality, coherence, character consistency, and plot logic. The AI should be able to help them inside the text editor while they are writing
    3. Allow simple author workflows from writing → editing → cover design → ISBN purchase → publishing-> service request e.g website, graphics, branding, events organization-> subscription purchase.
    4. Maintain all manuscripts securely and avoid repetitive uploads.
    5. Provide an interactive marketplace where authors can request NGANDIWEB services (graphics, marketing, author websites).
    6. Provide a support messaging system for order tracking and direct communication with NGANDIWEB.
    7. Enable authors to write and publish blog posts on the reader-facing platform.

3. TARGET USERS
    • New authors
    • Experienced authors
    • NGANDIWEB internal staff (Admin Dashboard)
    • Support team
    • Designers / Marketing Team

4. HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES
4.1 Authentication & User Accounts
    • Email + password authentication
    • MFA option
    • Password reset flow
    • Account profile management
    • Secure session management (JWT or Cognito)
    • AWS Cognito or custom auth (choose best option)
Security Requirement:
All manuscripts and user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.



5. CORE MODULES
5.1 Author Dashboard
Central hub showing:
    • Books in progress
    • Completed books
    • Recently edited manuscripts

    • Orders requiring attention
    • Support tickets
    • Blog posts
    • Quick actions: “Write New Book”, “Upload Book”, “Request Service”, “Design Cover”

I insist: UI must be clean, modern, and extremely intuitive.

5.2 Book Creation, Upload & Editing
5.2.1 Uploading
Authors must be able to upload:
    • DOCX
    • PDF
    • TXT

    • Rewrite paragraph
    • Expand or shorten sections

    • Character consistency (traits, voices, backstories)
    • Plot logic (continuity errors)
    • Chapter cohesion
    • Timeline consistency
    • Tone consistency
This AI must learn and improve as more authors use it (fine-tuning pipeline + retraining strategy).

    • All manuscripts stored securely
    • Metadata stored in database
    • No duplicate uploads
    • Book belongs to the author and is always accessible
